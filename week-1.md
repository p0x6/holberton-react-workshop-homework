# Mandatory Holberton School React Workshop Homework Week 1
## 1) Understand Lexical Environment and Variable Environments
We didn't go over the lexical environment during the session, it's up to you to figure this out on yourself.

- Write in psudo code / diagram what a function's execution stack looks like. There's not really a strict way to do this.

To submit this answer, include a link or attach your diagram / psudocode.

## 2) Closure
After understanding how a Javascript engine executes code. Now it's time to understand a very crucial concept of Javascript, closures.

This is a very commonly asked question in javascript interviews.

- Write a 1 sentence definition of a closure. (in the issue)
- Write a 4 sentence definition of a closure. (in the issue)
- Write a counter in Javascript using closure. JS fiddle

## 3) TypeScript
We talked about TypeScript a bit in the session and we setup your local typescript environment.

- Redo the 8 questions in the prework assignment in Typescript

NOTE:
```text
every function's arugments must be typed.
function definition should have typed return value.
No use of `any` anywhere, all objects must be typed.
all not built-in datatypes must be typed during declaration; IE, object, array, etc.
all class methods need to be explicitly either `public` or `private`.
private function naming should preceed with an `_` (underscore) IE. `private _someFunction() {}`
```

include the JS fiddle links in issue.
